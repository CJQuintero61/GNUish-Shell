DESCRIPTION:
    This repo contains all project related files for project 1 for Operating Systems (COSC-3346-001).
    The project is a GNUish shell that can parse an input string for tokens and run the desired UNIX command.
    There is also a new history command that can be displayed by using "hist" to show, up to, the last
    10 commands. "r n" can be used to re-run the nth command. Ex. "r" reruns the last command, "r 3" reruns
    the 3rd command from the history list, and so on.
